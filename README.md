## About Me
Good morning, my name is U.V.S. Srinivas. I am a Computer Science Engineering graduate from Mother Theresa College, and I am currently working as a Data Science Intern at Ramanasoft.

In my internship, I am gaining hands-on experience in Python, SQL, data analysis, and visualization by applying them to real-world projects. I have also built a strong foundation in Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Data Analytics through my AI and Data Science training.

I am proficient in Python, SQL, Pandas, NumPy, and Power BI, which helps me extract insights from data and design meaningful solutions. Additionally, my experience as a tutor and lab assistant has strengthened my communication, leadership, and problem-solving skills.
